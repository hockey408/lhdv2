The logic is:

1) If PROD_HIER_LEVEL_5 = 'Business RE Term Loans' and Bank_Code = 'L-CIT' then 'Samya'
2) If PROD_HIER_LEVEL_5 = ('Business Non-RE Term Loans' OR 'Business Commitment Draw') and Bank_Code = 'L-CIT' then 'Casey'
3) If PROD_HIER_LEVEL_5 = 'Business RE Term Loans' and Bank_Code = 'L-CIT' and Source_System_Balance < or = to 500000 then 'Not Covered; Under $500k; Samya'
4) If PROD_HIER_LEVEL_5 = ('Business Non-RE Term Loans' OR 'Business Commitment Draw') and Bank_Code = 'L-CIT' and Source_System_Balance < or = to 250000 then 'Not Covered; Under $250k; Casey'
5) If Contract_Source_System = 'INFL10' then 'Daniel'
6) If Bank_Code = 'L-SVB' then 'Eleanor'
7) If RBC_Code = 'R' then 'Autochange'
8) If population remains and Bank_Code = 'L-FCB' then 'Connor'
9) Else 'NOT COVERED'

I also need to work in some logic to create column 'Characterization' which will tag each ACCOUNT_IDENTIFIER as 'Downgrade IN', 'Exit', 'Persisting Balance Changes', and 'Autochange'.

-- ========================= Synthetic Tracking (CTE-only) =========================
-- Purpose: Flag synthetic/internal/plug-like records without creating tables/views.
-- How to use:
--   1) Edit the RULES_* blocks below to match your environment (CSS values, GL LIKEs, text markers).
--   2) Optional: set date filter in [params].
--   3) Run. Output returns one row per account_identifier x month with a risk_score and reasons.

/* ======================== RC_Code Anomaly Detection (Enhanced, single query) =========================
   - Models: REG12, REG36, MA6, MA12 with best model chosen by out-of-sample (last 3 months) RMSE,
             falling back to your original in-sample rule if needed.
   - Seasonality: Quarterly lifts from non-spike months, capped & shrunken, damped if recent spikes.
   - Residual / MoM metrics & Z-scores (per RC, per chosen model window).
   - Prediction Intervals: ±1.96 * RMSE (per-RC, per-model).
   - Severity: uses per-RC P95 scale for AbsResid and MoM_Abs (no POWER; no percentile functions).
               P95 is computed via rank logic: the first value at or above 95th percentile.
   - Flags: Persistent outlier (3 of last 6) and Reason_Code for explainability.
   - No views; no POWER().
